     <pre style="font-size: large;">
       To make a delicious Sandwhich, start by gathering the following ingredients: 
       1/4 pound of turkey, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, 
       1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1 clove of minced garlic, 2 hamburger 
       buns, and your favorite toppings such as lettuce, tomato, cheese, and condiments. 
       Begin by preheating  grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. In a mixing bowl, 
       combine the ground beef, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and minced garlic. 
       Mix everything together until well combined, but avoid overmixing to maintain a 
       tender texture. Divide the mixture into four equal portions and shape them into 
       patties, slightly larger than the size of the buns.
